# ARIA AT GitHub Actions Helper

This repo holds:
- workflow definitions for GitHub Actions
- pipeline defintions for Azure Pipelines
- scripts to run these jobs many times to test for inconsistent results

This repo's GitHub Actions queue is also where automated test runs from the [ARIA AT app](https://github.com/w3c/aria-at-app) are run.
